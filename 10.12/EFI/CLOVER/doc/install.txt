If you have built a Hackintosh before this is not the same process, there is no Multibeast or separate USB bootloader.
You will be prepping the drive that your machine will run off of directly from a Macbook Pro or Real Mac
Use a SATA SSD for this process
Use a real mac for everything before the "First Boot"(aside from copying the files to a fat32 formatted usb drive)
Read all the instructions before you begin
Understand all the instructions before you begin
If you don't understand something use the internet to learn more about it
If you don't understand how it all works you are in for a world of pain if something goes wrong
Follow the instructions
Follow the instructions
Follow the instructions
Unless you are advised to deviate based on Sin, Tom, Alex or Ryan's recommendation
Once your system is stable (we will have a checklist) Make a work functional back up.
This is insurance.
If something goes wrong on-set you can boot from your back up and keep working
Preparing the Install

EVERYTHING PRIOR TO "FIRST BOOT" SHOULD BE DONE ON A REAL MAC
Gather All the Software

    Download the Hack-Wack folder.
    This includes Clover Configurator, BIOS Firmware Update, BIOS settings profile, EFI folder and some post install files
    Source a copy of "Install macOS Sierra" v12.4.06

Format Sierra Installation Drive

    Open disk utility

Second Boot
AppleGraphicsPolicy Fix

    Reboot again replacing nvda_drv=1 with nv_disable=1
    Once booted we will follow method #4 found here https://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/solving-nvidia-driver-install-loading-problems.161256/#Problem4
    Method 4: (I have paraphrased for our specific use)
        Open Terminal
        Enter this command (it is one line)

            sudo nano /System/Library/Extensions/AppleGraphicsControl.kext/Contents/PlugIns/AppleGraphicsDevicePolicy.kext/Contents/Info.plist

        Arrow down to where you see <key>ConfigMap</key>
        For the MacPro6,1 locate the board-id "Mac-F60DEB81FF30ACF6" and change string below it from "Config1" to "none".
        Save the file by pressing CTRL+O, then enter.
        Exit by pressing CTRL+X
        Rebuild the kernel cache using the following two commands in terminal:
            sudo kextcache -system-prelinked-kernel hit "Enter"

                the above may throw an error but you can ignore it.

            sudo kextcache -system-caches hit "Enter"

                this command wont ask for your password again, when its complete it will just show you the prompt again

Audio Fix

THIS STEP WILL NOT WORK UNTIL YOU HAVE INTERNET

    Using Clover Configurator once again mount our EFI partition
    Open Clover Configurator
    Under the "Tools" section on the left-hand side click "Mount EFI"
    Click "Mount Partition" on the right-hand side next to your Hack-Wack install drive
    Open Terminal
    Drag audio_cloverALC-120.sh from Hack-Wack>PostInstall>audio_CloverALC-master into the Terminal
    Hit "Enter"
    Enter your password and hit "Enter" again
    you will hit 'y' 5 times in total to accept the changes being made

Second Ethernet Port (i211)

    Download the i211 kext files here
    Install the Smalltree driver package
    Install the kexts in the i211.zip using kextdrop or some other valid method.
    Files must be installed to /System/Library/Extensions - they may not work if in /Library/Extensions or in clover's kext folders
    reboot

Third Boot

    Reboot (This time you dont need to modify the boot flags and can just hit enter at the clover boot screen)
    Install Cuda
    Install Blackmagic Desktop Video
    Install DaVinci Resolve
    Install Codex Software
    Install Livegrade
    Install SilverStack
    Install anything else you need to function

Once everything is installed that you need to function bare minimum its time to do a clone of your drive
BACK UP YOUR INSTALL
DO NOT DO ANY OSX UPGRADES
GC-ALPINE RIDGE (TB Card) UPDATE

To use the TB adapter card you will have to do a few things first
Prerequisites

    Windows installed on your hack (using windows 10 for the guide)
    Access to internet
    Plug TB card into last slot only (PCIEX8)
    Plug the Thunderbolt power cable into the back of the TB card, then plug the other end into your motherboard: to the left of the Mobo power connector, under your GPU. You will probably have to take the GPU out to plug this cable in.

Download Firmware Updater

Both the mobo and the Alpine Ridge card need to be updated to firmware v. 21. There are two separate firmware updater utilities; one for the Alpine Ridge card (linked in Step 2 below) and one for the mobo (linked in the Downgrade Drivers section).

    Boot up into Windows
    Go Here
    Scroll down to the "Utilities" section and click to expand.
    Click one of the download locations. I chose "America", why not
    Save the file according to your browser. This is the updater for your Alpine Ridge card, not your mobo.
    DO NOT download the Thunderbolt driver from this page, only the firmware update tool.

Install Update

    Find the download
    Double-click "setup.exe"
    Click yes to allow the app to make changes to the device
    Click "next" at the "FashTBT B16.1118.1" screen
    Click "Finish"

Downgrade Drivers

Now the drivers need to be downgraded from v. 16.2.52.250 to v. 16.1.47.275, and the mobo firmware needs updating to v. 21.

    In Windows, uninstall "Thunderbolt Software".
    Once its done go here to download Thunderbolt FW Update Tool (under Utilities) and the TB driver (Driver--Thunderbolt): Here

        The Firmware Update Tool on that page is for your mobo, not your Alpine Ridge card. You will need to run this Updater in addition to the previous Updater. The driver here is the older version required for Hack compatibility.

    Install the older drivers

Check BIOS Settings

    Reboot
    Hit the Delete key to enter BIOS
    Go to the Peripherals" tab
    Got to "Intel(R) Thunderbolt" and hit Enter to go to the Thunderbolt sub-menu
    Make sure PCI cache is set to 128
    Make sure Prefetch is set to 256, you can change it by clicking on the number and typing in "256"
    Set the Security setting to Legacy
    Recommended: Re-save your profile to a slot
    Now Save and Exit

Back to the Hack

    Now that you have done all this you can boot back into your Hackintosh BUT FIRST
    Go into the boot options in the Clover menu and add "-s" so that the machine boots into single user mode
    Boot
    When the boot hangs type in "$exit" hit Enter
    then type "exit" and enter again
    there you go!

IMPORTANT NOTES
Not hot swappable
Must cold-boot with devices plugged in
Must populate port "1" to enable port "2"
